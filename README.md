## About
MochaTeX helps you generate professional looking PDFs by using your TEX files as templates and filling in the details with JSON.
Under the hood, it uses [pdfTeX / pdfLaTeX](https://tug.org/applications/pdftex) to create a PDF from a TEX file that has been filled in using [Go's templating package](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/).
